# :sparkles: Bibpaper :sparkles:

When we cite other scholars' papers, we often find that most of the articles searched by Google Scholar cite arxiv's preprint Bibtex (even if this paper has been __PUBLISHED__  in some journals or conferences), which makes our paper writing appear unprofessional. I wrote an automated script&exe __Bibpaper__ that can find what conference the paper has been cited by and return the response of the latest citation.

All you need to do is enter the title of the article and click Fetch Bibtex to get the Bibtex of the paper.
